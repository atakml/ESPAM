# General Descriptions

This project has two different parts. One part is the Baselines which contains material for the table 1 and 2 of the paper. Second part is MITIIA which includes the experiments related to GNN-CLS. To execute each of them the current directory should be switched to them. Therefore, for Baselines, from this directory the following instruction should be executed first:
```
cd Baselines
```
and for the MITIIA:
```
cd MITIIA/MITIIA
```

Once in the current directory, the specific README file is available.
